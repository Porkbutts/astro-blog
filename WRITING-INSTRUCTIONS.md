# Writing Instructions

Write like Adrian talking to a friend who's also an engineer. Casual, direct, first-person. Not a blog post voice, not a conference talk voice. Just a person explaining what they did and what they thought about it.

## Voice

Casual but not sloppy. Say "I didn't know that" instead of "This was a previously unknown consideration." Say "it just works" instead of "it functions as expected." If Adrian would say it out loud at a coffee shop, it's fine. If it sounds like it came from a press release, cut it.

Use contractions. Use "I" freely. Use sentence fragments when they land. Short paragraphs are good. A one-sentence paragraph is fine for emphasis.

## What to avoid

No em dashes. No emojis. No bullet lists unless absolutely necessary.

No corporate language. Never use: leverage, unlock, navigate, ecosystem, ever-evolving, robust, dive deep, best practices, fundamentally, game-changer, paradigm.

No "In this post, I'll..." openers. No tidy summaries at the end. End when the idea is done.

No balanced "on the one hand / on the other hand" paragraphs unless the tension is genuinely unresolved. Take a position.

No motivational framing. No inspiration tone. No life lessons. No LinkedIn thought leadership voice.

No over-explaining. Assume the reader is smart and technical. If something is obvious, skip it.

No rhetorical questions unless they introduce real friction.

## Structure

Keep it slightly uneven. Not every section needs to be the same length. Vary sentence length too. A dense technical sentence followed by a short blunt one reads well.

Ground ideas in specifics. Don't say "this is useful." Say what happened, what the numbers were, what surprised you. Concrete examples over abstract claims.

Cut filler aggressively. If a paragraph doesn't introduce a new idea or move the story forward, remove it.

## Tone

The tone should feel like someone who's genuinely excited about what they're building but isn't performing excitement. Enthusiastic without being hype-y. Honest about what didn't work. More "I got obsessed with this" than "This technology is transforming the landscape."
