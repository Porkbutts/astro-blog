I'm Adrian Teng-Amnuay, a software engineer with 10+ years of experience building production infrastructure at scale. My work has always been about making complex systems reliable — and now I'm applying that same discipline to AI automation.

## Background

I spent the first decade of my career deep in cloud infrastructure, container orchestration, and production security. The kinds of systems I've built include:

- **Service mesh architectures** spanning hundreds of Kubernetes clusters and nearly a thousand applications
- **Zero-trust authentication proxies** handling thousands of requests per second for entire organizations
- **Custom container orchestration platforms** that scale to millions of concurrent containers
- **AI-powered developer tools** that help engineers navigate complex codebases and configurations

The through-line is taking complex operational problems and building systems that handle them reliably. AI automation is the latest — and most interesting — version of that.

## What I Do Now

**Focus areas:**

- **Agentic systems** — designing AI agents that operate reliably in production environments
- **Workflow automation** — building pipelines that connect AI capabilities to real business processes
- **Developer tooling** — creating tools that make AI-assisted development practical and repeatable
- **Infrastructure** — deploying and operating AI workloads with the same rigor as any other production system

## What This Site Covers

This blog is where I write about the engineering side of AI automation. Expect build logs, architectural breakdowns, framework comparisons, and lessons learned from putting these systems into production.

I write for engineers and technical leaders who want to move beyond prompt engineering into building real AI-powered infrastructure.
