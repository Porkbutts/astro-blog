I'm Adrian Teng-Amnuay. I've spent the last 10+ years building production infrastructure, and now I build AI automation systems.

The short version: I got into this through cloud infrastructure, container orchestration, and production security. Service meshes across hundreds of Kubernetes clusters, zero-trust auth proxies at thousands of requests per second, container platforms scaling to millions of concurrent workloads, AI-powered developer tools for navigating complex codebases. The common thread was always taking messy operational problems and building systems that handle them without falling over.

AI automation is the current version of that same problem. The interesting engineering isn't the model itself. It's the orchestration, failure handling, state management, and integration work that makes a model call actually useful inside a real system.

## What I work on

I focus on agentic systems, workflow automation, developer tooling, and the infrastructure underneath all of it. Most of my time goes into designing AI agents that behave reliably in production, building pipelines that connect AI capabilities to actual business processes, and deploying AI workloads with the same operational rigor as anything else running in prod.

## What this site is for

I write about the engineering side of AI automation. Build logs, architectural decisions, framework comparisons, and things I've learned from putting these systems into production. The audience is engineers and technical leaders who are past the prompting phase and want to build real infrastructure around AI.
