This is the first post on this blog, so let me start with the basics: who I am, what I'm building, and why I'm writing about it.

## Who I Am

I'm Adrian Teng-Amnuay, a software engineer with 10+ years of experience in production infrastructure, cloud systems, and security. I've spent my career building things that have to work at scale and can't go down — service mesh architectures spanning hundreds of Kubernetes clusters, zero-trust authentication systems handling thousands of requests per second, custom container orchestration platforms scaling to millions of concurrent containers.

More recently, I've been building AI-powered tools and workflows: natural language interfaces that replace tedious manual configuration, and LLM-powered developer tools that help engineers navigate complex codebases. That work is what pulled me fully into the AI automation space.

## Why This Blog Exists

The AI space moves fast, and most of the conversation happens on Twitter threads and YouTube thumbnails. What's harder to find is detailed, practical writing about what it actually takes to build AI-powered systems that work in production.

I've spent a decade learning that the hard part of any system isn't the core technology — it's everything around it. Failure modes, observability, deployment, integration, operations. That's just as true for AI systems as it was for service meshes and authentication proxies.

That's the gap I want to fill. This blog is where I'll document what I'm building, what I'm learning, and the frameworks I use to think about these problems.

## What to Expect

Here's what you'll find on this site:

- **Build logs** — walkthroughs of real projects, including the decisions, tradeoffs, and mistakes
- **Case studies** — breakdowns of AI automation systems I've built or studied
- **Frameworks** — mental models for thinking about agent architectures, workflow design, and system reliability
- **Experiments** — smaller explorations of new tools, techniques, and approaches

I'm writing for engineers and technical leaders who want to go beyond prompting and start building real AI infrastructure. If that's you, I think you'll find something useful here.

Let's get started.
